Entrex project  February 21, 2023

The Entrex Trapezoid is a piece of ancient computing history.
A data entry terminal with a unique serial interface.

This is something I am collaborating with AJ on.

The "rom" directory has the 8080 disassembler, the ROM firmware files,
and most importantly, the annotated ROM disassembly.

The "remap" directory has a python script
(and some instructions for using it) that I use to
relabel signals on his KiCAD schematic.
